# 🔧 How It Works 
- `fork()` command is creating a new child process ( exact copy of parent). Both run independently, can use `wait` to get a bit deterministic.
- `execvp` command replaces current process with new program, essentially changing the program.
- `cd` is not a system command
- `perror` is used for system calls related erros
- Singal Handling: A interrupt that is sent to running process by kernel, ex - CTRL+Z which generates `SIGINT`. Can make custom signal handler using `signal` function.
